#summary CSharp Game Programming Introduction

= Introduction =

This repository is for the code accompanying the book 
[http://www.amazon.com/dp/1435455568/ref=nosim?tag=dansspiels-21 C# Game Programming: For Serious Game Creation]

OpenGL and C# are used to build a fast hardware accelerated 2D engine with an example scrolling shooter game. 


= Details =

To run the code:
  * Download all the source and examples
  * Make sure you've got the latest greatest version of the [http://www.microsoft.com/net/download.aspx .NET libraries.]
  * Install [http://sourceforge.net/projects/taoframework/ Tao] and [http://www.nunit.org/?p=download NUnit]
  * The Engine project is just a library of code, to see anything you'll want to run the Shooter example.
  * In your bin\debug and bin\release directory you should have the following .dll files, some will be copied in automatically some you'll have to find in Tao installation directory:
    * alut.dll
    * DevIL.dll
    * Engine.dll (this will be auto-generated by the Engine library.)
    * ILU.dll
    * ILUT.dll
    * OpenAL32.dll
    * SDL.dll

Once this done you should be ready to develop!

= How you can help =

Your  first step should be to dash over to amazon and [http://sourceforge.net/projects/taoframework/ grab a copy of the book] - then you can join in on all the fun :D If you think you've got something cool to add let me know. It would be nice to get rid of the shoddy programmer art :D
(If you're a reasonably experienced programmer you can probably just grab the source and get the jist of things without the book - not, of course, the recommended method :D)




Edit this:

      public Texture Texture
        {
            get { return _texture; }
            set
            {
                _texture = value;
                // By default the width and height is set
                // to that of the texture
                InitVertexPositions(GetCenter(), _texture.Width, _texture.Height);
            }
        }
