This repository is for the code accompanying the book 
[http://www.amazon.com/dp/1435455568/ref=nosim?tag=dansspiels-21 C# Game Programming: For Serious Game Creation]

OpenGL and C# are used to build a fast hardware accelerated 2D engine with an example scrolling shooter game. 


= Details =

To run the code:
  * Download all the source and examples
  * Make sure you've got the latest greatest version of the [http://www.microsoft.com/net/download.aspx .NET libraries.]
  * Install [http://sourceforge.net/projects/taoframework/ Tao] and [http://www.nunit.org/?p=download NUnit]
  * The Engine project is just a library of code, to see anything you'll want to run the Shooter example.
  * In your bin\debug and bin\release directory you should have the following .dll files, some will be copied in automatically some you'll have to find in Tao installation directory:
    * alut.dll
    * DevIL.dll
    * Engine.dll (this will be auto-generated by the Engine library.)
    * ILU.dll
    * ILUT.dll
    * OpenAL32.dll
    * SDL.dll

Once this done you should be ready to develop!

If you think you've got something cool to add let me know. It would be nice to get rid of the shoddy programmer art :D
